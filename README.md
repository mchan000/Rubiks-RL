# Rubik's Cube Training Environment and Model
Implemented:
* Uses PPO and MLPpolicy to train custom Rubik's cube environment
* Can solve up to 9 random moves away. Anymore and it gets iffy.

Things to do:
* Further train model to solve cube in more complex states
* Utilize another algorithm that better trains Rubiks cube
